This project uses NPM as a main build package builder along with these frameworks:

- Bootstrap for styling
- React:
  - React-Router:
  - Redux
- mocha

In order to get started you want to run the command "npm install". After you have installed all the commands use "npm run start" to run the lint checks, unit tests, and launch a deployment app if the previous operations are successful. If you're curious on the webpack setup for the npm commands that are hooks for it look for the "package.json" file and then the corresponding "webpack.config.[env].js" file that is listed under the command.
